Exploiting game mechanics is not allowed.\n4. <TextStyle.Green>Be a Helpful and Supportive Community Member:</> Assist new players, share knowledge, and be a positive presence on the server. Building a friendly and cooperative community is essential for a successful PvE experience.\n5. <TextStyle.Green>No Blocking Obelisks and Artifacts:</> Do not build near or block access to obelisks, artifact caves, or other crucial map locations, as these are important for progression.\n6. <TextStyle.Green>No Cave Blocking:</> Do not obstruct access to caves, as these locations are vital for players to explore and gather resources.\n7. <TextStyle.Green>Follow Admin Guidelines:</> Respect the server administrators and moderators. They have the authority to enforce rules, resolve disputes, and maintain order on the server.\n8. <TextStyle.Green>Report Rule Violations:</> If you witness someone breaking these rules, report it to the server administrators or moderators.
